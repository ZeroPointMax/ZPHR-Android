Android Client for ZeroPointHifiRemote (ZPHR).

Bring new life into your old HiFi by retrofitting it into the digital world! Strap on a Raspberry Pi with a DAC (keep Ductape withing reach) and install some software like Spotify Connect and `gmediarender`! The only thing missing is basically Volume Control and the option to open Internet Streams.

This is where ZPHR is intended to help out.
